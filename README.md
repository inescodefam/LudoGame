# Ludo Game

A classic Ludo board game implementation built with JavaFX.

## Description

This project is a digital version of the traditional Ludo board game, developed as part of a Java programming course. The game demonstrates advanced Java concepts including multithreading, reflection, and JavaFX UI development.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Support** - 2-4 players can play on the same device
- **Interactive UI** - Built with JavaFX for smooth graphics and animations
- **Dice Rolling** - Animated dice with random number generation
- **Game Rules** - Complete implementation of standard Ludo rules
- **Token Movement** - Automatic path calculation and collision detection

## Technologies & Concepts

- **Java** - Core programming language
- **JavaFX** - UI framework for desktop application
- **Multithreading** - Concurrent game logic and UI updates
- **Reflection** - Dynamic class loading and method invocation
- **OOP Principles** - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- **MVC Pattern** - Separation of concerns in architecture

## How to Play

1. Launch the application
2. Select number of players (2-4)
3. Roll the dice by clicking the dice button
4. Move your tokens according to dice value
5. First player to get all tokens to the finish wins

## Ludo Rules

- Roll a 6 to move a token out of the starting area
- Tokens move clockwise around the board
- Landing on an opponent's token sends it back to start
- Rolling a 6 grants an extra turn
- All four tokens must reach the home column to win

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
- JavaFX SDK

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)
3. Configure JavaFX library path
4. Run `Main.java`

## Learning Outcomes

- Implementing game logic with multithreading
- Using reflection for dynamic behavior
- Building interactive UIs with JavaFX
- Managing game state and player turns
- Handling user input and events
